This is a Django Web project i worked on during my Django Web devolopment course, it was submitted as my final project to pass the course.
There are a few certain things that need to be done to view this project properly, mainly python and django need to be set up.

For Django set up: 
( $ python -m pip install Django ) 
(Although I recommend looking up how to set up Django instead) 

And set up for additional tools I used that may be needed: 

For Bootstrap3: 
(pip install django-bootstrap3)

For Widget Tweaks: 
($ pip install django-widget-tweaks)
